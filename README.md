# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game
A simple Tic Tac Toe game made using Python..
It is a two player game...
Player1 can choose X and the other player gets O or vice versa
Game won't move forward until Player1 enters either X or O (upper or lowercase doesn't matter, beacuse program got a .upper() function)
It's fun! Go play!
THANKYOU!
